## Overview

This was a very fun project to work on. This project allowed me to spend more time practicing my layout skills with flexbox. This is a simple project but certain small details made it a little more difficult. Overall I really enjoyed the experience and I look forward to doing more FM junior projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Durring this project I learned that its okay to use position absolute/relative when its nessecary. The important thing is understanding which times it is needed. Here is a snapshot of me using position relative on the floating bottom card in this project.  

```css
.bottom-card{
  box-shadow: 0em 0em .2em .1em hsla(209, 11%, 55%, 0.19);
  background-color: white;
  margin-top: 3em;
  padding-block: 3em;
  border-radius: 1em;
  position: relative;
  bottom: -4.5em;
  text-align: center;
  padding-inline: .5em;
}
```

### Continued development
At The moment I plan to start collaborating with others on frontend mentor projects  and learning javascript. I look forward to learning and growint with my peers and gaining knowledge in Javscript.
